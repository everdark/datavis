Data Visualization Exercise!
=======
### Intro
The repo collects all of my learning notes and scripts along with other relevant files about the `ggplot2`, `gridSVG`, and `rCharts` package.

The `ggplot2` package provides a unified method of various plotting facilities with fairly fine-tuned default graph parameters. The `gridSVG` instead provide interface to add dynamics and interaction to grid-based graph, which can be properly presented on browser environment. (Yes, `ggplot2` is grid-based.)

The `rCharts` package provides a powerful hogh-level interface to multiple javascript dynamic graphing libraries, for example the notably NVD3.js.
