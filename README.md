Data Visualization Exercise!

### Intro
The repo collects all of my learning notes and scripts along with other relevant files about the **ggplot2** and **gridSVG** package.

The **ggplot2** package provide a unified method of various plotting facilities with fairly fine-tuned default graph parameters. The **gridSVG** instead provide interface to add dynamics and interaction to grid-based graph, which can be properly presented on browser environment. (Yes, **ggplot2** is grid-based.)

For ggplot2, the main reference is [Winston Chang's R Graphics CookBook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do).
